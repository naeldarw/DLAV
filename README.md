Our planning model consists of a CNN that extracts hierarchical spatial features of the camera image, and returns a final ouput volume, that then goes through a ViT, which returns a learned special token. We then concatenate this learned token and the history, and finally, they jointly go through a final MLP decoder that ouputs the future/predicted waypoints.
